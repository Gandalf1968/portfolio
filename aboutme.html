        <h1> A little about myself</h1>
        <h2> I grew up in North Glengarry County in Ontario, Canada. I attended Laggan Public school from K-8, then 9-12 at Glengarry District High School in Alexandria, Ontario.</h2>
        <h2>After high school, I took a year off and worked out in BC. I then came back and enrolled at St. Lawrence College in Cornwall, Ontario, where I would meet my future wife. When she graduated from nursing and took a job in southern Texas, I went with her. We spent 5 years there and have 2 kids.</h2>
        <h2> We then moved to Macklin, Saskatchewan, where we lived for 23 years.</h2>

        <h2>Quoting a saying that was introduced to me by  one of my instructors:</h2>
