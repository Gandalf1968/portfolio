 <p><h1> A little about myself</h1></p>
    <p><h2> I grew up in North Glengarry County in Ontario, Canada.  I attended Laggan Public school, from K-8, then 9-12 at Glengarry District High School in Alexandria, Ontario.</h2></p>
    <p><h2>After high school I took a year off and worked out in BC.  I then came back and enrolled at St. Lawrence College in Cornwall, Ontario, where I would meet my future wife.  When she graduated from nursing and took a job in southern Texas, I went with her.  We spent 5 years there, have 2 kids.</h2><p></p> 
    <h2> We then moved to Macklin, Saskatchewan where we lived for 23 years.</h2></p>
